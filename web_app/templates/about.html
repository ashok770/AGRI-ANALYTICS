  <h1>Project Methodology & Goal</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    This application provides an accurate and transparent forecast of crop
    yields to help farmers and agribusinesses make better resource decisions.
  </p>

  <div class="section-card">
    <h2>The Problem: The “Black Box” Gap</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional machine learning models predict outcomes but fail to explain
      <strong>why</strong> they reached that conclusion. In agriculture, a
      farmer needs to know whether low yield is caused by fertilizer usage,
      rainfall, or temperature to take corrective action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal was to solve this <strong>Explainability Gap</strong> by building
      an analytical application that delivers both predictions and root-cause
      insights.

    <h2>The Solution: An Explainable ML Pipeline</h2>

    <div class="methodology-details">
      <div class="detail-box">
        <h3>1. Data Sources</h3>
        <p>
          The model was trained on historical global datasets including
          <strong>Rainfall, Average Temperature, Pesticide Usage</strong>, Crop
          Type, and Geographic Area.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="detail-box">
        <h3>2. Core Model</h3>
        <p>
          We used a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong>, an ensemble model
          well-suited for capturing complex, non-linear relationships in
          agricultural data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="detail-box">
        <h3>3. Performance</h3>
        <p>
          The model achieved an <strong>R² score of ~0.9875</strong>, explaining
          over 98% of yield variability — indicating strong predictive
          reliability.
        </p>

  <div class="section-card">
    <h2>Key Analytical Insight (The “WHY”)</h2>
    <p>Feature importance analysis revealed the top global drivers of yield:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>#1:</strong> Crop Type (e.g., Potatoes)</li>
      <li><strong>#2:</strong> Pesticide Tonnes Applied</li>
      <li><strong>#3:</strong> Average Temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By highlighting these factors, the application converts predictions into
      <strong>actionable decision support</strong>.
