        <h1>Project Methodology & Goal</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">This application provides an accurate and transparent forecast of crop yields to help farmers and agribusinesses make better resource decisions.</p>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h2>The Problem: The "Black Box" Gap</h2>
            <p>Traditional machine learning models predict outcomes but fail to explain **why** they reached that conclusion. In agriculture, a farmer needs to know if low yield is due to fertilizer or low rainfall to take corrective action.</p>
            <p>Our goal was to solve this **Explainability Gap** by building an analytical application that delivers both a prediction and its root cause analysis.</p>

            <h2>The Solution: An Explainable ML Pipeline</h2>
            <div class="methodology-details">
                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>1. Data Sources</h3>
                    <p>The model was trained on a large historical dataset combining global records for: **Annual Rainfall, Average Temperature, Pesticides Application,** Crop Type, and Location (Area).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>2. Core Model</h3>
                    <p>We used the **Random Forest Regressor** model. This is an ensemble method highly effective at capturing complex, non-linear relationships between weather/soil factors and crop yield.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-box">
                    <h3>3. Performance</h3>
                    <p>The model achieved an **R² Score of ~0.9875**, meaning it explains over 98% of the variability in crop yield. This demonstrates high predictive accuracy.</p>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h2>Key Analytical Insight (The 'WHY')</h2>
            <p>Our **Feature Importance** analysis revealed the top global factors driving yield prediction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**#1:** Crop Type (e.g., Potatoes)</li>
                <li>**#2:** Pesticide Tonnes Applied</li>
                <li>**#3:** Average Temperature</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By highlighting these factors, the app turns a simple prediction into **actionable advice** for resource allocation.</p>
